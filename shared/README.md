# Hectoc Library

The Hectoc library in the [shared](.shared) folder contains some Java classes to generate Hectocs
and check solutions with a modified version of a [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm)
and stacks.

You can use that library, if you want to implement your own Java apps or tools for Hectocs.

## Build

The projects are structured as multimodule maven project.
It should be sufficient to call `maven compile` in the parent directory.
To create a jar file, call `maven package`

## Run
TBD...
