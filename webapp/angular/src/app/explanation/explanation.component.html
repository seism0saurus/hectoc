<h2>Hectoc</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
Hectocs are mathematical challenges developed by

More infos are available in German at <a href="https://wir-rechnen.de/hectoc">https://wir-rechnen.de/hectoc</a>
<br/>
Hectocs are so popular, that a <a href="https://wir-rechnen.de/veranstalungen/hectoc-meisterschaft">German
  Championship</a> exists.
There's also an open competition during the preparation days of the <a href="http://www.juniormentalcalculators.com/">Junior
  Mental Calculation World Championship</a>
Those persons and organisations are unrelated to this project.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li>A hectoc consists of 6 random numbers from 1-9.</li>
  <li>The goal is to combine these 6 numbers to a total of 100.</li>
  <li>You can use the mathematical operations + - * / ^ and the two parenthesis ( ).</li>
  <li>Numbers can be combined to form bigger numbers with multiple digits.</li>
  <li>You have to use all 6 of them.</li>
  <li>You must not change the order of the numbers.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>
The hectoc is <b>991347</b>.<br/>
It can be solved with <b>99+1-(3+4-7)</b>. The first two numbers are combined to 99.
Then, 1 is added, and the result from 3+4-7 is subtracted.<br/>
But it can also be solved with <b>9+91+3+4-7</b>.

<h3>About this project</h3>
This site is a private project from me -<a href="https://seism0saurus.de">seism0saurus</a>-
because I really like these challenges and want others to have fun with it.<br/>
The algorithm to check your solution is based on a modified <a
